# Energy Optimization Readme

This repository contains code that aims to optimize energy consumption and cost savings by effectively managing a photovoltaic (PV) system, battery storage, and grid usage. The code analyzes energy generation and consumption patterns to determine the most optimized way to save electricity in the battery, balance the use of the grid and battery, and intelligently send excess energy back to the grid.


# Introduction

## Battery Storage Optimization with Grid Interaction

This graph visualizes the battery energy levels throughout the day, demonstrating an optimized energy management scenario. The fluctuations represent a dynamic strategy where:

- **Photovoltaic (PV) energy** is stored in the battery system.
- **Excess electricity** is sold back to the grid when advantageous.
- **Grid interaction** is optimized to enhance energy efficiency and economic benefits.

By leveraging this approach, the system maximizes renewable energy utilization while ensuring energy availability for operational needs.

### Key Insights:
- The battery experiences continuous charging and discharging cycles.
- Energy storage supports grid stability and reduces reliance on non-renewable sources.
- The model aims to achieve **cost savings** and **carbon footprint reduction**.

This study provides insights into **smart energy storage solutions** and their role in **sustainable power management**.
