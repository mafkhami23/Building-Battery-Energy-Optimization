# Energy Optimization Readme

This repository contains code that aims to optimize energy consumption and cost savings by effectively managing a photovoltaic (PV) system, battery storage, and grid usage. The code analyzes energy generation and consumption patterns to determine the most optimized way to save electricity in the battery, balance the use of the grid and battery, and intelligently send excess energy back to the grid.


# Introduction

The optimization of energy consumption and cost savings has become crucial in today's world. This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging the power of PV systems, battery storage, and intelligent grid management. The code takes into account various factors such as energy generation from PV, energy demand, battery capacity, and electricity tariffs to devise an optimized strategy for energy usage.
